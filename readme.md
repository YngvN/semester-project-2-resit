My resit for Semester Project 2 with Noroff

Site: https://auctionhome.netlify.app/

## Description

With this project I've attempted to use a simple style. You should be able to

- Search listings
- Create a user, log in and log out
- Create listings, view them, and view the ones where the user has the highest bid
- View the highest bids

Some neat features are

- A timer that counts down the time left
- If the user has the highest bid then it should display it
- General messages are placed inside a custom modal

## Built With

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Noroff API](https://docs.noroff.dev/)

## How to run

- Run "npm run build"
